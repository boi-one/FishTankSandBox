# Fish Tank SandBox

a project where fish swim around and eat the food you give them. You can also catch new fish.

features:  
- catch fish  
- feed fish
- multiple fish

## the tank
When the game starts you begin with one fish swimming around in the fish tank.  
This will always be a red fish. At the top left is a button called 'spawn food'  
if the food is spawned the fish will swim to it and eat it. Every time the fish eats 5 pieces of food it grows.  
When 2 fish swim past each other one of them can lay an egg. If you don't give the fish any food he will DIE.  
Another button at the top left is 'go to pond' when this button is pressed you will go to another screen with a fishing rod where you can catch other fish.

## the pond
The to buttons at the top left are 'open bail' and 'hook view'. When open bail is pressed the hook will go down very fast.
With this button you can reach the bottom of the pond very quickly. With the other button you can see where the hook is. When hook view is not enabled you can move the rod by dragging it with your mouse.
If the hook moves too fast past the fish in the pond they get scared and will swim away. You can catch a fish by keeping the hook on one place and waiting until a fish bites the hook. 
If the fish is on your hook you'll need to move the hook very slowly otherwise the fish can get away. If you manage to reach the top the fish is catched and a screen with the statistics of the fish will show. In this screen you can give your fish a name.
You also have the choice to sell your fish or keep it in your tank. Collect all the different kind of fish to beat the game.
